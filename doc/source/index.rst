   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Boss Development Tools
======================

The Boss project provides 'Baseline Open Source Software' templates and 
development tools.  It has similarities to Paste Script with regards to 
templating, but far easier to extend.  Though Boss is written in Python, it is 
not limited to any particular language. Boss is very beta... any feedback is 
welcome and appreciated.
